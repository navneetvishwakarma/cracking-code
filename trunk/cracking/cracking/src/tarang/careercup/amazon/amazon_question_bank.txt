29) A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if and
A[P] + A[Q] > A[R],
A[Q] + A[R] > A[P],
A[R] + A[P] > A[Q].
For example, consider array A such that
A[0] = 10 A[1] = 2 A[2] = 5
A[3] = 1 A[4] = 8 A[5] = 20
Triplet (0, 2, 4) is triangular.
public int triangle(int[] A)
that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns 1 if there exists a triangular triplet for this array and returns 0 otherwise.
Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range[-2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
For example, given array A such that
A[0] = 10 A[1] = 2 A[2] = 5
A[3] = 1 A[4] = 8 A[5] = 20
the function should return 1, as explained above. Given arrayA such that
A[0] = 10 A[1] = 50 A[2] = 5
A[3] = 1
the function should return 0.
Expected worst-case time complexity: O(n log n)
Expected worst-case space complexity: O(1)

Write a program to implement Boggle Game.
You are given a 4x4 matrix of letters and a dictionary, find all the valid words in the matrix. Following are the conditions
1. If a letter is used, it should not be used again in the same word search
2. The word path can be of any direction
3. There has to be a path of the letters forming the word( in other words all the letters in the word must have to adjacent to one another)

Example:


D A T H
C G O A
S A T L
B E D G


Some of the Valid words are:
DATA, HALO, HALT, SAG, BEAT, TOTAL, GLOT, DAG


Not valid words:
DAGCD ( D cannot be used again)
DOG ( There is no path between letters)

37) Find height of a tree without using recursion

38)

Jump Game:
Given an array start from the first element and reach the last by jumping. The jump length can be at most the value at the current position in the array. Optimum result is when u reach the goal in minimum number of jumps.
For ex:
Given array A = {2,3,1,1,4}
possible ways to reach the end (index list)
i) 0,2,3,4 (jump 2 to index 2, then jump 1 to index 3 then 1 to index 4)
ii) 0,1,4 (jump 1 to index 1, then jump 3 to index 4)
Since second solution has only 2 jumps it is the optimum result.
